Peano Axiom 1 is a natural number. If \\(n\\) is a natural number then \\(n++\\) is also a natural number. 1 is not a successor of any natural number. Hence, \\(n++\\neq 1\\) for every natural number \\(n\\) . For two natural numbers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) : if \\(m\\neq n\\) then \\(m++\\neq n++\\) or if \\(m=n\\) then \\(m++=n++\\) . Principle of mathematical induction: Let \\(P(n)\\) be any property pertaining to natural number \\(n\\) . Suppose that \\(P(1)\\) is true and suppose that whenever \\(P(n)\\) is true, \\(P(n++)\\) is also true. Then \\(P(n)\\) is true for every natural number \\(n\\) . Operations of Natural numbers From Peano Axioms only one operation ( i.e. increment) is defined on natural number. The repeated application of this operation can used to define other operations on natural numbers like addition and multiplication. Addition Definition: For a natural number \\(m\\) , we define \\(m++ = m+1\\) and by induction if this addition operation can be defined for \\(n++\\) as \\(m+n++ = (m+n)++ = m+(n+1)\\) Based on this definition of addition, following properties of addition can be established: 1. Addition is commutative. i.e. \\(n+m = m+n\\) 2. Addition is associative. i.e. \\((a+b)+c = a+(b+c)\\) 3. Cancellation law: if \\(a+b=a+c\\) , then \\(b=c\\) . These properties can be proved by using principle of mathematical induction (the last Peano axiom). Moreover, the operation of addition also lead to ordering in natural number. Definition of zero and whole number Zero (written as 0) is a number whose successor is 1 and for any natural number \\(a\\) , \\(a+0=a\\) . If we include 0 in the set of natural number then the set is called whole number. Ordering of natural numbers Definition: Let \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) are natural numbers. We say that \\(n\\) is equal or greater than \\(m\\) and write it \\(n\\geq m\\) (or \\(m\\leq n\\) ), iff we have \\(n=m+a\\) for some whole number \\(a\\) . We say that \\(n\\) is strictly greater than \\(m\\) (written as \\(n>m\\) ) iff \\(n\\geq m\\) and \\(n\\neq m\\) . Using mathematical induction, following properties of ordering in whole numbers can be established ( \\(a\\) , \\(b\\) , and \\(c\\) are whole numbers): 1. Order is reflexive. \\(a\\geq a\\) 2. Order is transitive. If \\(a\\geq b\\) and \\(b\\geq c\\) , then \\(a\\geq c\\) . 3. Order is anti-symmetric. If \\(a\\geq b\\) and \\(b\\geq a\\) , then \\(a=b\\) . 4. Addition preserves order. If \\(a\\geq b\\) , then \\(a+c \\geq b+c\\) . 5. \\(a<b\\) iff \\(a++\\geq b\\) . 6. \\(a<b\\) iff \\(b = a + d\\) for some natural number d. Proposition 1: Trichotomy of order for whole numbers: If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are whole numbers then exatly one of the following statements is true: \\(a<b\\) , \\(a=b\\) , or \\(a>b\\) . Proposition 2: Strong principle of mathematical induction: let \\(m_0\\) be a whole number, and let \\(P(m)\\) be a property pertaining to an arbitrary whole number \\(m\\) . Suppose that for each \\(m\\geq m_0\\) , we have the following implication: if \\(P(m')\\) is true for all natural numbers \\(m_0\\geq m' \\geq m\\) , then \\(P(m)\\) is also true. (In particular, this means that \\(P(m_0)\\) is true, since in this case the hypothesis is vacuous.) Then we can conclude that \\(P(m)\\) is true for all natural numbers \\(m\\geq m_0\\) .","tags":"Maths","url":"https://mayanksuman.in/posts/25_Jun_2021_natural-numbers/","loc":"https://mayanksuman.in/posts/25_Jun_2021_natural-numbers/"},{"title":"Data Analytics Basics","text":"Data is collection of facts that cane used to draw conclusions, make prediction and assist in decision-making.

The list of following 23 problems were published in a 2019 paper. 1 Time variability and change Is the hydrological cycle regionally accelerating/decelerating under climate and environmental change, and are there tipping points (irreversible changes)? How will cold region runoﬀ and groundwater change in a warmer climate (e.g. with glacier melt and permafrost thaw)? What are the mechanisms by which climate change and water use alter ephemeral rivers and groundwater in (semi-) arid regions? What are the impacts of land cover change and soil disturbances on water and energy ﬂuxes at the land surface, and on the resulting groundwater recharge? Space variability and scaling What causes spatial heterogeneity and homogeneity in runoﬀ, evaporation, subsurface water and material ﬂuxes (carbon and other nutrients, sediments), and in their sensitivity to their controls (e.g. snow fall regime, aridity, reaction coeﬃcients)? What are the hydrologic laws at the catchment scale and how do they change with scale? Why is most ﬂow preferential across multiple scales and how does such behaviour co-evolve with the critical zone? Why do streams respond so quickly to precipitation inputs when storm ﬂow is so old, and what is the transit time distribution of water in the terrestrial water cycle? Variability of extremes How do ﬂood-rich and drought-rich periods arise, are they changing, and if so why? Why are runoﬀ extremes in some catchments more sensitive to land-use/ cover and geomorphic change than in others? Why, how and when do rain-on-snow events produce exceptional runoff? Interfaces in hydrology What are the processes that control hillslope–riparian–stream– groundwater interactions and when do the compartments connect? What are the processes controlling the ﬂuxes of groundwater across boundaries (e.g. groundwater recharge, inter-catchment ﬂuxes and discharge to oceans)? What factors contribute to the long-term persistence of sources responsible for the degradation of water quality? What are the extent, fate and impact of contaminants of emerging concern and how are microbial pathogens removed or inactivated in the subsurface? Measurements and data How can we use innovative technologies to measure surface and subsurface properties, states and ﬂuxes at a range of spatial and temporal scales? What is the relative value of traditional hydrological observations vs soft data (qualitative observations from lay persons, data mining etc.), and under what conditions can we substitute space for time? How can we extract information from available data on human and water systems in order to inform the building process of socio-hydrological models and conceptualisations? Modelling methods How can hydrological models be adapted to be able to extrapolate to changing conditions, including changing vegetation dynamics? How can we disentangle and reduce model structural/parameter/input uncertainty in hydrological prediction? Interfaces with society How can the (un)certainty in hydrological predictions be communicated to decision makers and the general public? What are the synergies and tradeoﬀs between societal goals related to water management (e.g. water–environment–energy–food–health)? What is the role of water in migration, urbanisation and the dynamics of human civilisations, and what are the implications for contemporary water management?

It should be noted that environment for inner function ( i.e. , the variable divisor ) is also saved with the returned function. Hence, following line of codes work: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 div_by_7 = divisiblity_check ( 7 ) div_by_19 = divisiblity_check ( 19 ) div_by_7 ( 38 ) # return false div_by_19 ( 38 ) # return true div_by_7 ( 35 ) # return true div_by_19 ( 35 ) # return false Here, although the functions div_by_7 and div_by_19 are returned by same closure function; however they have different environment attached to them and hence produce different results. The example closure function ( i.e. , divisiblity_check ) can also be defined using anonymous function. 1 2 3 4 def divisiblity_check ( divisor ): \"\"\"Factory for producing functions that check divisiblity with divisor.\"\"\" return lambda divident : ( divident % divisor == 0 ) This usage is sometimes called anonymous closure function.","tags":"Programming","url":"https://mayanksuman.in/posts/21_May_2021_closure-functions/","loc":"https://mayanksuman.in/posts/21_May_2021_closure-functions/"},{"title":"First Class Functions","text":"In most programming languages, type, object, entity, or value is considered first-class object and hence can be returned from a function, modified or assigned to a variable. If a programming language considers functions as first-class object, then the programming language is said to have first-class functions. Hence, in such programming languages (like Python, JavaScript and others), a function can be assigned to variable, modified or returned from a higher order function. Usually such languages also supports anonymous functions. First-class function is one of the necessity for functional programming; hence all functional programming languages (such as Haskell, Scala, Clojure etc.) have first-class functions. Example 1 2 3 p = print p ( \"Hi! Check out this text.\" ) p . __call__ ( \"Hi! Check out this text.\" ) Here print function is assigned to variable p and then called using syntax p(...) similar to print(...) . It should be noted that the last line is specific to python only. In python almost every thing is a object. Functions are special object that __call__ data structure function (or member) defined for them.

Surely, the default values in virt-manager do not result in the most performant Windows virtual machine out of box. Still, with the following tips one can get a very performant virtual machine setup (with low computational load additionally): Please ensure that the disk file to be created for the virtual machine is not on a BTRFS partition. Furthermore, at the last step of new virtual machine wizard in virt-manager , click Customize configuration before install .

Additional Tip: For sharing files from Linux host, you have two options a) by USB redirection of attached pen drive b) by WebDAV. For using WebDAV, Spice WebDAV Daemon should be installed in Windows guest. Add a new channel hardware with target name org.spice-space.webdav.0 .
