On debian this can be achieved by sudo apt install cryptsetup . At first creat the file that will act as encrypted drive/volume. Please ensure that the file should be >= 100MB in size. The file will then be formatted with cryptsetup . This step will demand either a passphrase or key file (following example commands are for passphrase case). 1 2 fallocate -l 100M encrypted_volume.enc sudo cryptsetup -y luksFormat encrypted_volume.enc In case, if you want to use key file, you can generate a key-file with random bits using head -c 4kB /dev/urandom > key_file_path;sync or dd if=/dev/urandom of=key_file_path bs=1000 count=4;sync . Next while doing luksFormat with cryptsetup command, add --key-file key_file_path in the command. For security, save the key file at a safe location with proper permission (for example chmod 400 key_file_path ), because losing or modifying key-file will mean loss of data in encrypted volume. It should be noted additional passphrase or key-files can be added to encrypted_volume.enc with cryptsetup luksAddKey command. Now, open the volume inside file with cryptsetup and format it with ext4 partition. 1 2 sudo cryptsetup luksOpen encrypted_volume.enc encrypted_vol sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/mapper/encrypted_vol You can go with other filesystem or even with lvm2 . The volume can be mounted in any folder by using mount command. 1 sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/mapper/encrypted_vol target_folder After accessing the data in the volume, the volume should be unmounted and the mapping should be closed 1 2 sudo umount /dev/mapper/encrypted_vol sudo cryptsetup luksClose encrypted_vol Additional Tips To get information about existing encrypted device, use the command cryptsetup luksDump device_path . If you do not want to enter passphrase everytime you open an encrypted drive, add a key-file to it using cryptsetup luksAddKey command, get the UUID for the encrypted device by sudo blkid (or cryptsetup luksDump or cryptsetup luksUUID ), and then put following line in /etc/crypttab : 1 device_mapper_name UUID = encrypted_drive_UUID key_file_path luks For added safety, you can backup LUKS Header of encrypted drive. Backed up LUKS Header can come handy in cases when header in actual encrypted drive is corrupted or missing. For backing and restoring header, following commands are used. 1 2 cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup <device> --header-backup-file <file> cryptsetup luksHeaderRestore <device> --header-backup-file <file> After taking backup of LUKS Header, all pass-phrases and key-files can be removed from encrypted device by cryptsetup luksErase . However, this operation will render the device unusable, so it is highly recommended that a backup of header is taken before. Such a device can then be opened using cryptsetup luksOpen --header=header_file_path command. For an encrypted device, the command cryptsetup -v isLuks <device_path> give command successful message (hence, it reveals that device is encrypted with LUKS ). If you want to avoid detection, take a backup of header and then run wipefs -a <device_path> to remove all information about filesystem in encrypted device. After this step, the encrypted drive can only be opened using cryptsetup luksOpen --header=header_file_path command.","tags":"Software","url":"https://www.mayanksuman.in/posts/21_Nov_2021_create-encrypted-volume-inside-file/","loc":"https://www.mayanksuman.in/posts/21_Nov_2021_create-encrypted-volume-inside-file/"},{"title":"Better sound quality in obs-studio","text":"A extensive guide for audio mixing is presented at https://indiscipline.github.io/post/voice-sound-reference/ .","tags":"Software","url":"https://www.mayanksuman.in/posts/30_Aug_2021_better-sound-quality-in-obs-studio/","loc":"https://www.mayanksuman.in/posts/30_Aug_2021_better-sound-quality-in-obs-studio/"},{"title":"Hardware-Accelerated Window capture ( NVIDIA FBC ) in OBS -Studio","text":"For getting hardware-accelerated window capture on obs-studio, first we need to patch the nvidia-driver in using https://github.com/keylase/nvidia-patch .

Peano Axiom 1 is a natural number. If \\(n\\) is a natural number then \\(n++\\) is also a natural number. 1 is not a successor of any natural number. Hence, \\(n++\\neq 1\\) for every natural number \\(n\\) . For two natural numbers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) : if \\(m\\neq n\\) then \\(m++\\neq n++\\) or if \\(m=n\\) then \\(m++=n++\\) . Principle of mathematical induction: Let \\(P(n)\\) be any property pertaining to natural number \\(n\\) . Suppose that \\(P(1)\\) is true and suppose that whenever \\(P(n)\\) is true, \\(P(n++)\\) is also true. Then \\(P(n)\\) is true for every natural number \\(n\\) . Operations of Natural numbers From Peano Axioms only one operation ( i.e. increment) is defined on natural number. The repeated application of this operation can used to define other operations on natural numbers like addition and multiplication. Addition Definition: For a natural number \\(m\\) , we define \\(m++ = m+1\\) and by induction if this addition operation can be defined for \\(n++\\) as \\(m+n++ = (m+n)++ = m+(n+1)\\) Based on this definition of addition, following properties of addition can be established: Addition is commutative. i.e. \\(n+m = m+n\\) Addition is associative. i.e. \\((a+b)+c = a+(b+c)\\) Cancellation law: if \\(a+b=a+c\\) , then \\(b=c\\) . These properties can be proved by using principle of mathematical induction (the last Peano axiom). Moreover, the operation of addition also lead to ordering in natural number. Definition of zero and whole number Zero (written as 0) is a number whose successor is 1 and for any natural number \\(a\\) , \\(a+0=a\\) . If we include 0 in the set of natural number then the set is called whole number. Ordering of natural numbers Definition: Let \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) are natural numbers. We say that \\(n\\) is equal or greater than \\(m\\) and write it \\(n\\geq m\\) (or \\(m\\leq n\\) ), iff we have \\(n=m+a\\) for some whole number \\(a\\) . We say that \\(n\\) is strictly greater than \\(m\\) (written as \\(n>m\\) ) iff \\(n\\geq m\\) and \\(n\\neq m\\) . Using mathematical induction, following properties of ordering in whole numbers can be established ( \\(a\\) , \\(b\\) , and \\(c\\) are whole numbers): Order is reflexive. \\(a\\geq a\\) Order is transitive. If \\(a\\geq b\\) and \\(b\\geq c\\) , then \\(a\\geq c\\) . Order is anti-symmetric. If \\(a\\geq b\\) and \\(b\\geq a\\) , then \\(a=b\\) . Addition preserves order. If \\(a\\geq b\\) , then \\(a+c \\geq b+c\\) . \\(a<b\\) iff \\(a++\\geq b\\) . \\(a<b\\) iff \\(b = a + d\\) for some natural number d. Proposition 1 : Trichotomy of order for whole numbers: If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are whole numbers then exatly one of the following statements is true: \\(a<b\\) , \\(a=b\\) , or \\(a>b\\) . Proposition 2 : Strong principle of mathematical induction: let \\(m_0\\) be a whole number, and let \\(P(m)\\) be a property pertaining to an arbitrary whole number \\(m\\) . Suppose that for each \\(m\\geq m_0\\) , we have the following implication: if \\(P(m')\\) is true for all natural numbers \\(m_0\\geq m' \\geq m\\) , then \\(P(m)\\) is also true. (In particular, this means that \\(P(m_0)\\) is true, since in this case the hypothesis is vacuous.) Then we can conclude that \\(P(m)\\) is true for all natural numbers \\(m\\geq m_0\\) .","tags":"Maths","url":"https://www.mayanksuman.in/posts/25_Jun_2021_natural-numbers/","loc":"https://www.mayanksuman.in/posts/25_Jun_2021_natural-numbers/"},{"title":"Data Analytics Basics","text":"Data is collection of facts that cane used to draw conclusions, make prediction and assist in decision-making.

The list of following 23 problems were published in a 2019 paper. 1 Time variability and change Is the hydrological cycle regionally accelerating/decelerating under climate and environmental change, and are there tipping points (irreversible changes)? How will cold region runoﬀ and groundwater change in a warmer climate (e.g. with glacier melt and permafrost thaw)? What are the mechanisms by which climate change and water use alter ephemeral rivers and groundwater in (semi-) arid regions? What are the impacts of land cover change and soil disturbances on water and energy ﬂuxes at the land surface, and on the resulting groundwater recharge? Space variability and scaling What causes spatial heterogeneity and homogeneity in runoﬀ, evaporation, subsurface water and material ﬂuxes (carbon and other nutrients, sediments), and in their sensitivity to their controls (e.g. snow fall regime, aridity, reaction coeﬃcients)? What are the hydrologic laws at the catchment scale and how do they change with scale? Why is most ﬂow preferential across multiple scales and how does such behaviour co-evolve with the critical zone? Why do streams respond so quickly to precipitation inputs when storm ﬂow is so old, and what is the transit time distribution of water in the terrestrial water cycle? Variability of extremes How do ﬂood-rich and drought-rich periods arise, are they changing, and if so why? Why are runoﬀ extremes in some catchments more sensitive to land-use/ cover and geomorphic change than in others? Why, how and when do rain-on-snow events produce exceptional runoff? Interfaces in hydrology What are the processes that control hillslope–riparian–stream– groundwater interactions and when do the compartments connect? What are the processes controlling the ﬂuxes of groundwater across boundaries (e.g. groundwater recharge, inter-catchment ﬂuxes and discharge to oceans)? What factors contribute to the long-term persistence of sources responsible for the degradation of water quality? What are the extent, fate and impact of contaminants of emerging concern and how are microbial pathogens removed or inactivated in the subsurface? Measurements and data How can we use innovative technologies to measure surface and subsurface properties, states and ﬂuxes at a range of spatial and temporal scales? What is the relative value of traditional hydrological observations vs soft data (qualitative observations from lay persons, data mining etc.), and under what conditions can we substitute space for time? How can we extract information from available data on human and water systems in order to inform the building process of socio-hydrological models and conceptualisations? Modelling methods How can hydrological models be adapted to be able to extrapolate to changing conditions, including changing vegetation dynamics? How can we disentangle and reduce model structural/parameter/input uncertainty in hydrological prediction? Interfaces with society How can the (un)certainty in hydrological predictions be communicated to decision makers and the general public? What are the synergies and tradeoﬀs between societal goals related to water management (e.g. water–environment–energy–food–health)? What is the role of water in migration, urbanisation and the dynamics of human civilisations, and what are the implications for contemporary water management?

Usually such languages also supports anonymous functions. First-class function is one of the necessity for functional programming; hence all functional programming languages (such as Haskell, Scala, Clojure etc.) have first-class functions.

The language is equally suited for learning as the first computer language (for kids) and running enterprise-level code (as done in many startups and established companies) at the same time. However, this incredible approachability of the language leads to very low quality of code (due non-pythonic way of writing code) and many misinterpretations about it. This series about generic python show use-cases and examples of pythonic code, which are clear and effective. Let us start with Zen of Python by Tim Peters, which can be accessed by code import this in python interpreter. The principles are: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity. Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. Now is better than never. Although never is often better than *right* now. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! We will use these principles as general guidance in this series.","tags":"Programming","url":"https://www.mayanksuman.in/posts/30_Jul_2020_starting-up-a-series-of-python-language/","loc":"https://www.mayanksuman.in/posts/30_Jul_2020_starting-up-a-series-of-python-language/"},{"title":"Setting up Skype for web in Debian","text":"I do not prefer having closed source software on my Debian machine. However, due to the popularity of Skype, the package skypeforlinux was installed on my Debian system. Finally, I am able to get rid of the binary blob by using the web version of the service. If you also want to get rid of the binary software and still want to have the convenience offered by it, the steps are listed below: Get rid of skypeforlinux package by sudo apt purge skypeforlinux command. Make a text file named skype_web.desktop in ~/.local/share/applications with following content. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 [Desktop Entry] Name = Skype Web Comment = Skype Web application in a Chrome profile Exec = sh -c \"mkdir -p $HOME/.local/share/skypeweb && GDK_BACKEND=x11 chromium --kiosk --user-data-dir=$HOME/.local/share/skypeweb https://web.skype.com 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null &\" Terminal = false Type = Application Encoding = UTF-8 Categories = Network;Application; In the activities panel of gnome-shell, select Skype Web to start it. Login with your credentials and select to remain logged in. Enjoy Skype from the web interface. Further, it also frees me from worry that skype might be running in the background. If chromium is closed, the skype is no longer running.","tags":"software","url":"https://www.mayanksuman.in/posts/21_Mar_2020_setting-up-skype-for-web-in-debian/","loc":"https://www.mayanksuman.in/posts/21_Mar_2020_setting-up-skype-for-web-in-debian/"}]};
